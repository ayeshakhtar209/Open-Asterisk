                <h3>References and links</h3>
                <p>References and links to third party websites lie outside the scope of responsibility of the authorities involved in the opendata.swiss portal. Access and use of such websites occurs entirely at the user’s own risk. The authorities involved in the opendata.swiss portal expressly state that they have no influence whatsoever over the design, content or offering of any linked site. Responsibility for information and services of linked sites rests entirely with the relevant third party. No liability can be accepted in respect of the content of such websites.</p>
                
                <h3>Data protection</h3>
                <p>Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the provisions of Swiss data protection legislation, everyone has the right to the protection of privacy, as well as to protection from misuse of their personal details. The authorities involved in the opendata.swiss portal comply with these provisions. Personal data is treated as strictly confidential on the opendata.swiss portal and is neither passed on nor sold to third parties.</p>
                <p>In close cooperation with our hosting providers, we make every effort to protect the databases from outside access, data loss, misuse or falsification.</p>
                <p>When you access opendata.swiss, the following data is stored in log files: IP address, date, time, browser request and general information on the operating system and browser. Our hosting providers’ web servers merely register impersonal site usage data (log files) for the purpose of tracking trends for the authorities involved in the opendata.swiss portal in order to improve the information offering. For further information on web analysis, see the next section.</p>
                <p>Usage data are not linked to personal data. There is an exception, namely when you choose to make contact with us. If you register your e-mail address, this is then stored in a separate database not connected in any way with the anonymous log files. You may delete your registration at any time.</p>
                
                <h3>Web analysis</h3>
                <p>opendata.swiss uses the open-source web analysis service Piwik. Piwik uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer to help the website to analyse the use made of the site by its users. To this end, the usage information generated by the cookie (including your abbreviated IP address) is transferred to our server in Switzerland and stored for usage analysis purposes. This data is used to optimise the website. In this process, your IP address is anonymised without delay.</p>
                <p>You can prevent cookies being stored by changing your browser settings accordingly; however, this may mean that not all the functions of the website can be used.</p>
                
                <h3>Copyright</h3>
